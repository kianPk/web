             Repeated seconds print once, so four throws on one call read as one
             moment instead of four identical rows.

             Rows fold rather than pop: a step you just added should arrive
             where it belongs, and one you removed should take its space with
             it. The fold is why `move` behaves -- when the list changes the

             out of the way, then the collapse carries the rows below it. -->
