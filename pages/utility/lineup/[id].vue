 * A lineup no longer has a page of its own. It has an address on the map it
 * belongs to -- `/utility/<map>?lineup=<id>` -- which opens the same detail
 * without throwing away the board and the list you were reading. This route
 * stays only so links already out in the world still land somewhere.
 *
 * The redirect runs at the MIDDLEWARE stage, before this component mounts.
 * Calling navigateTo from setup while the page is still resolving inside
 * <NuxtPage>'s <Suspense> deadlocks the swap: the router resolves but the
 * target never mounts, leaving the spinner below stuck forever.
